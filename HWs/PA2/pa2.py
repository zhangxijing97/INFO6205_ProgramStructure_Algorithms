PA2: Dynamic Programming â€“ All Construct Problem

Assignment Requirements:
--------------------------
(1) Subproblem Definition:
    - We want to determine all the different ways to construct a given target string using a list of words (wordbank).
    - Let F(target, wordbank) be the function that returns a 2D list of ways to build the target.
      For every word in the wordbank that is a prefix of the target, the problem reduces to solving for the suffix.
      The final result is assembled by prepending the matched word to every solution obtained for the suffix.
    - Base Case: When the target is empty (""), return [[]] representing one valid way (using no words).

(2) Decisions and Recursion:
    - Recursively check each word in the wordbank.
    - Use memoization (caching results in a dictionary) to speed up repeated subproblems.
    - As required by the assignment, print the solution for each subproblem as they are solved.
    
(3) Error Handling:
    - The program checks that the required command-line arguments are provided.
    - If arguments are missing or invalid, it prints a usage message and exits gracefully.

Usage:
------
Run the program from the command line:
    python pa2.py --target <target string> --wordbank <list of words>

Example:
    python pa2.py --target purple --wordbank purp p ur le purpl

(5) Example 1 execution output:

(base) zhangxijing@MacBook-Air PA2 % python pa2.py --target purple --wordbank purp p ur le purpl
Solving subproblem for target: 'purple'
Solving subproblem for target: 'le'
Completed subproblem for target: 'le' with solutions: [['le']]

Solving subproblem for target: 'e'
Completed subproblem for target: 'e' with solutions: []
